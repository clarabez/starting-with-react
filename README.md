### General notes about React:

- It is a lib, not a framework;
- It is not exclusive for web. Example, we have React Native to build mobile apps; React 360 to build virtual reality and more stuff like this.
- React is focused in renreding so we, devs, can be more concentrated in the UI itself;
- We can use React in a single component like a button, for example.
- JSX means JavaScript + XML. That is the main difference between React and JavaScript.
